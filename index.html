<p>Combining Music with High-Tech.</p>
<p>
Hello, my name is Anna-Maria Christodoulou (or @MuTecEn). 
I am a PhD student at UiO, working on Multimodal Music Information Retrieval, using AI.
I find the field of MIR very fascinating and try to stay up to date with all the new 
menthods for intelligent music analysis and the various related fields that benefit from
such methods, for example recommender systems, AI-generative music and music therapy. 
I enjoy working on MIR projects that are not only reliable and ethical, but also 
accessible and even beneficial to everyone interested in the musical sound. 
<p> 
In my free time, I get my hands dirty by music programming and experimenting with
creative music technologies, in terms of sound design and live coding. I am a member
of MCCC Lab, currently working on “Music in Everyday Life” research. Furthermore,
I am a member of NKUA’s Radio Production Team, LEME, CogniHu, Deree’s WiTS Club
and IT Society. I am also attending various interesting events, conferences and 
workshops, such as IMPROTECH, MusMat, London Audio Meetup(), Athens PyLadies, ISMIR,
AIMIC and ISMS. 
<p>
My experience with music technology, (audio) programming and related tools include: Reaper,
Audacity, Python, C/C++, Matlab, MAX/MSP, SuperCollider, ChucK, HTML, XML, WordPress,
MSOffice, Azure, Ubuntu, FMOD, Unity, MIT Sonification Sandbox, SciPy, music21, Tony, 
Sonic Visualizer, Praat, Spear, SoundGrain, MuseScore, Illustrator, VCV Rack, Sonobus 
and LoopMIDI.

You can find more about my projects on GitHub and you can view some of my original music
  works on my YouTube channel. Also, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.  </p>
