      <p>Combining Music with High-Tech.</p></center>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Anna-Maria Christodoulou (or <a href="https://twitter.com/MuTecEn">@MuTecEn</a>) and I am an
      <a href="https://en.music.uoa.gr/undergraduate_studies/">MA in Sound Technology graduate</a>, also holding an IT minor from
      the American College of Greece. I find the field of MIR very fascinating and try to stay up to date with all the new menthods
      for intelligent music analysis and the various related fields that benefit from such methods, like music classification, 
      recommender systems, AI-generative music and AI-assisted music therapy. I enjoy working on MIR projects that are not only 
      reliable and ethical, but also accessible and even beneficial to everyone interested in the musical sound. Currently, I am a
      PhD student at <a href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/about/">RITMO, UiO</a>, working on Multimodal Music Information Retrieval, using AI.
      </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I get my hands dirty by music programming and experimenting with the creative use of MIR. More specifically,
      I like working on live coding, both creatively() and academically(). I am a member of LEME (). I am also a member of MCCC Lab,
      currently working on “Music in Everyday Life” research. Furthermore, I am a member of NKUA’s Radio Production Team, Deree’s WiTS
      Club and IT Society. I am also a Podcast Producer for CogniHub, implementing intelligent production techniques, using DL.
      I am also attending various interesting events, conferences and workshops, such as IMPROTECH, MusMat, London Audio Meetup(), 
      ISMIR, AIMIC and ISMS. 
      </p>

      My experience with music technology, (audio) programming and related tools include: Reaper, Audacity, Python, C/C++, Matlab, 
      MAX/MSP, SuperCollider, ChucK, HTML, XML, WordPress, MSOffice, Azure, Ubuntu, FMOD, Unity, MIT Sonification Sandbox, SciPy,
