            Hello, I'm Anna-Maria Christodoulou (<a href="https://twitter.com/MuTecEn">@MuTecEn</a>), a researcher working at the intersection of music, technology, and 
      artificial intelligence. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. at RITMO, UiO, my research focuses on Multimodal Music Information
      Retrieval using cutting-edge AI techniques (https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/people/phd-fellows/annammc/index.html). As
      a dedicated advocate for reliable, ethical, and accessible Music Information Retrieval (MIR) projects, I advocate for
      accessible and inclusive MIR systems. My journey involves not only academic pursuits but also hands-on experimentation with
      creative MIR applications, including automated music generation and participation in multiple Hachathons. 
      
      Beyond my individual endeavors, I take pride in spearheading the Greek MIR Society - MUSAI Gr. Our mission is to bring
      MIR awareness to the Greek community, bridging the realms of music and computer science for enthusiasts and the general
      audience alike. From informative weekly posts and basic MIR tutorials to interactive races and engaging paper readings,
      MUSAI Gr strives to make MIR accessible to everyone.
      
      Here's a glimpse into my academic background: I hold an MA in Sound Technology with a minor in AI and am currently 
      pursuing a Ph.D. in Deep Learning for Multimodal Music Information Retrieval. My educational journey has taken me from
      the American College of Greece to the University of Oslo, with a stint at Charles University in Prague.
      
      In the professional arena, I've lent my expertise as a Music Data Analyst at Masterchannelai and conducted research in
      the MIRAGE project at RITMO, UiO. But it's not all about work. In my free time, you'll find me immersed in projects 
      like "Transmissions", live coding, learning a new language (spoken, programming, or music programming!), and podcasting.
      
      Feel free to contact me for a collaboration or a chat!
