    <p>
      Hello, my name is Anna-Maria Christodoulou (or <a href="https://twitter.com/MuTecEn">@MuTecEn</a>) and I am an
      <a href="https://en.music.uoa.gr/undergraduate_studies/">MA in Sound Technology graduate</a> with an IT minor.
      From January 2023, I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/about/">RITMO, UiO</a>, working
      on Multimodal Music Information Retrieval, using AI. I enjoy working on MIR projects that are not only reliable and 
      ethical, but also accessible and even beneficial to everyone interested in the musical sound. I enjoy attending many
      MIR-related events and conferences, while I represent and strongly support the female presense in the field. 
      </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I get my hands dirty by music programming and experimenting with the creative use of MIR. More specifically,
      I like working on live coding, both creatively() and academically(). I am also a Podcast Producer for CogniHub, implementing
      intelligent production techniques, using DL.

      ABOUT MUSAI Gr:
      I am the founder and coordinator of the Greek MIR Society - MUSAI Gr. Our main goal is to raise awareness onMIR in the
      greek community, attracting people with music and/or computer science background, but also the general audience. We aim to 
      achieve our goals, through three main actions: Musai Informative Reposts (weekly posts about MIR trends and updates), Musai
      Instructive Recordings (basic MIR tasks tutorials), Musai Interactive Races (MIR Capture The Flags) and Musai Interesting 
      Readings (weekly MIR paper readings).
