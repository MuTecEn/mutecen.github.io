<p>Combining Music with High-Tech.</p>
<p>
Hello, my name is Anna-Maria Christodoulou (or @MuTecEn). 
I am a Music Acoustics and Sound Technology graduate, holding an IT minor. 
I am mostly interested in MIR projects, such as automated music transcription,
generation and analysis, as well as building recommender systems and protecting
music copyrights. I also enjoy working on music projects that are not only 
reliable and ethical, but also accessible and even beneficial. 
Currently, I am an intern at Vouli Tv, working on Music Production and Sound Editing.
  
In my free time, I get my hands dirty by music programming and experimenting with
creative music technologies, in terms of sound design and live coding. I am a member
of MCCC Lab, currently working on “Music in Everyday Life” research. Furthermore,
I am a member of NKUA’s Radio Production Team, LEME, CogniHu, Deree’s WiTS Club
and IT Society. I am also attending various interesting events, conferences and 
workshops, such as IMPROTECH, MusMat, London Audio Meetup(), Athens PyLadies, ISMIR,
AIMIC and ISMS. 

My experience with music technology, programming and related tools include: Reaper,
Audacity, Python, C/C++, Matlab, MAX/MSP, SuperCollider, ChucK, HTML, XML, WordPress,
MSOffice, Azure, Ubuntu, FMOD, Unity, MIT Sonification Sandbox, SciPy, music21, Tony, 
Sonic Visualizer, Praat, Spear, SoundGrain, MuseScore, Illustrator, VCV Rack, Sonobus 
and LoopMIDI.

You can find more about my projects on GitHub and you can view some of my original music
  works on my YouTube channel. Also, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.  </p>
