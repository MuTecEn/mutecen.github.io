<h1>MuTecEn</h1>
<p>Combining Music with High-Tech.</p>
<p>
Hello, my name is Anna-Maria Christodoulou (or <a href="https://twitter.com/MuTecEn">@MuTecEn</a>) and I have an 
<a href="https://twitter.com/MuTecEn">MA in Music Technology</a> from Athens University, also holding an IT minor from the American College of Greece.
I find the field of MIR very fascinating and try to stay up to date
with all the new menthods for intelligent music analysis and the various related fields that benefit
from such methods, like music classification, recommender systems creation, AI-generative music and
AI-assisted music therapy. I enjoy working on MIR projects that are not only reliable and ethical, 
but also accessible and even beneficial to everyone interested in the musical sound. I am a PhD student
at <a href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/about/">UiO</a>, working on Multimodal Music Information Retrieval, using AI.
</p> 
<p>
In my free time, I get my hands dirty by music programming and experimenting with
creative music technologies, in terms of sound design and live coding. I am a member
of MCCC Lab, currently working on “Music in Everyday Life” research. Furthermore,
I am a member of NKUA’s Radio Production Team, LEME, CogniHu, Deree’s WiTS Club
and IT Society. I am also attending various interesting events, conferences and 
workshops, such as IMPROTECH, MusMat, London Audio Meetup(), Athens PyLadies, ISMIR,
AIMIC and ISMS. 
</p>
<p>
My experience with music technology, (audio) programming and related tools include: Reaper,
Audacity, Python, C/C++, Matlab, MAX/MSP, SuperCollider, ChucK, HTML, XML, WordPress,
MSOffice, Azure, Ubuntu, FMOD, Unity, MIT Sonification Sandbox, SciPy, music21, Tony, 
Sonic Visualizer, Praat, Spear, SoundGrain, MuseScore, Illustrator, VCV Rack, Sonobus 
and LoopMIDI.
