      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Anna-Maria Christodoulou</strong>, a PhD researcher, musician, and technologist. My work lies at the intersection of <strong>music and technology</strong>, where I explore how machine learning and multimodal information processing can deepen our understanding of music.</p>

      <p>With a strong academic background in <strong>Music Technology</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, I aim to bridge the gap between <strong>scientific research</strong> and <strong>artistic expression</strong>. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge algorithms for music information retrieval (MIR) or working with creative music applications, I am deeply committed to fostering a more <strong>inclusive</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong>, and <strong>explainable</strong> music technology landscape.</p>

      <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
      <p>I hold a <strong>Master's degree in Music Technology</strong> from the <strong>National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA)</strong>, where I gained expertise in <strong>music programming</strong>, <strong>signal processing</strong>, and <strong>interactive systems</strong>. Currently, I’m pursuing my PhD at <strong>RITMO, University of Oslo</strong>, focusing on <strong>multimodal music understanding</strong> through <strong>deep learning</strong>.</p>

      <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I’ve worked as a <strong>Music Data Analyst</strong> at Masterchannelai and contributed as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> to the MIRAGE project at RITMO, UiO. These roles have allowed me to combine my technical skills with my passion for music.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
      <p>As the <strong>founder of MUSAI Gr</strong>, I lead efforts to raise awareness about Music Information Retrieval (MIR) in Greece. This includes organizing events, tutorials, and discussions to make MIR approachable for both specialists and general audiences.</p>

      <p>Outside academia, I’ve collaborated on creative projects such as <strong>documentary production</strong> for the Hellenic Parliament TV and <strong>live electronic music</strong> performances with the LEME Ensemble.</p>
